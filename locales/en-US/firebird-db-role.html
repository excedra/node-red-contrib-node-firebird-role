    <p>Allows basic access to a Firebird database.</p>
    <p>This node uses the <b>query</b> operation against the configured database. This does allow both INSERTS and DELETES.
    By its very nature it allows SQL injection... so <i>be careful out there...</i></p>
    <p><code>msg.topic</code> must hold the <i>query</i> for the database, and the result is returned in <code>msg.payload</code>.</p>
    <p><code>msg.payload</code> can contain an array of values to bind to the topic.</p>
    <p>Typically the returned payload will be an array of the result rows.</p>
    <p>If nothing is found for the key then <i>null</i> is returned.</p>
